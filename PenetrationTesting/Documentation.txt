Kali Linux Setup for Penetration Testing with bWAPP

1. Download and Install Kali Linux
   - Grab the latest Kali Linux ISO from https://www.kali.org.
   - Install Kali Linux on VMware Fusion if you're using a MacBook.
   - Adjust your VM settings for better performance:
     - Give it at least 4GB of RAM and 2 CPUs.
     - Enable Bridged Networking so it connects properly.

2. Update and Upgrade Kali Linux
   Open the terminal and run:
   ```
   sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
   ```

3. Install Required Tools
   Run these commands to install the necessary tools:
   ```
   sudo apt install apache2 mysql-server php php-mysqli -y
   sudo systemctl status apache2
   sudo systemctl status mysql
   ```

4. Download and Set Up bWAPP
   Move to the web root directory:
   ```
   cd /var/www/html
   ```
   Clone the bWAPP repository:
   ```
   sudo git clone https://github.com/ethicalhack3r/bWAPP.git
   ```
   Adjust permissions so everything runs smoothly:
   ```
   sudo chown -R www-data:www-data bWAPP
   sudo chmod -R 755 bWAPP
   ```

5. Configure the MySQL Database
   Start MySQL:
   ```
   sudo systemctl start mysql
   ```
   Log in as root:
   ```
   sudo mysql -u root -p
   ```
   Inside MySQL, create the database and import the bWAPP data:
   ```
   CREATE DATABASE bWAPP;
   USE bWAPP;
   SOURCE /var/www/html/bWAPP/database.sql;
   exit;
   ```

6. Start Apache and Access bWAPP
   Restart Apache:
   ```
   sudo systemctl restart apache2
   ```
   Now open your browser and go to:
   ```
   http://localhost/bWAPP/login.php
   ```
   Use these credentials to log in:
   - Username: bee
   - Password: bug

7. Verify and Start Pentesting
   Run an nmap scan to make sure everything is reachable:
   ```
   nmap -p 80 localhost
   ```
   From here, you can start testing with tools like Burp Suite, SQLmap, and Metasploit.

That's it! Now youâ€™re all set to begin your penetration testing with bWAPP.
